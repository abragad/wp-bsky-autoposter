Create a WordPress plugin named "AutoPoster to Bluesky" (directory name wp-bsky-autoposter) that automatically publishes a new post to a specified Bluesky profile when it's published.

---

**Functionality Requirements:**

1. When a new post is published (`publish_post` action):
   - Format the message using a customizable template that supports `{title}`, `{excerpt}`, `{link}` placeholders.
   - Use the post's **canonical/public URL** for `{link}`.

2. Immediately include a **rich link preview (social card)** in the Bluesky post:
   - Use the `embed.external` type as per AT Protocol.
   - Extract the following from the post’s Open Graph or post data:
     - `uri`: The post URL.
     - `title`: Post title.
     - `description`: Post excerpt or meta description.
     - `thumb`: Featured image — uploaded to Bluesky's blob endpoint.

3. Use the AT Protocol (App Password) to authenticate and post:
   - Authenticate using a username (handle) and app password (these will be set in plugin settings).
   - Post to Bluesky using proper headers and payload to include `embed.external` with uploaded image.

---

**Settings Page:**

- Create a settings page under Settings > "Bluesky AutoPoster" with fields:
  - Bluesky handle (@handle.bsky.social or DID)
  - App Password
  - Post format template
  - Optional: fallback text if excerpt is missing

Use the WordPress Settings API and sanitize inputs properly.

---

**Best Practices:**

- Use `wp_remote_post()` or `wp_safe_remote_post()` for HTTP calls.
- Use WordPress functions to get post metadata (`get_the_excerpt()`, `get_the_post_thumbnail_url()`).
- Upload the image to Bluesky via their blob upload endpoint before posting.
- Handle and log errors with admin notices or a debug log.
- Plugin is currently in English, but provide all strings for translation in a .po file

---

**File Structure Suggestions:**

- Main plugin file: registration and hooks.
- Separate files or functions for:
  - Settings page
  - Post formatting
  - API communication (auth, blob upload, post submit)

Comment and document code thoroughly. Follow WordPress PHP coding standards.

FURTHER PROMPTS

Now, I would like to add a new section in settings, titled "Link Tracking" with a checkbox labelled "Enable link tracking parameters" that can turn the whole section on or off. Default is off. If on, we can have these 5 parameters that can be set independently:
utm_source, with default "bsky"
utm_medium, with default "social"
utm_campaign, with default "feed"
utm_term, with no default
utm_content, with no default

The link for the WordPress post would then be augmented with these parameters before being sent to Blueksy. Please pay attention to the construction of the full URL and escaping the values of the parameters.
The values inside can contain one or more of the placeholders {id} or {slug} that would be expanded into the post->id or post->slug for the given article.
